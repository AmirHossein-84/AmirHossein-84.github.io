Hi, I’m **Amir Hossein**, a data science student and Python programmer passionate about transforming data into insight.  
I’m currently studying Computer Science with a focus on data science, machine learning, and algorithmic problem solving.

When I’m not working on models or learning new frameworks, you’ll probably find me playing guitar — I enjoy the the energy of rock and metal.  
I believe in practical learning, building real projects, and constantly refining my understanding of how data can power decisions and creativity.

📍 Based in Iran
