<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

Hi, I’m **Amir Hossein**, a data science student and Python programmer passionate about transforming data into insight.  
I’m currently studying Computer Science with a focus on data science, machine learning, and algorithmic problem solving.

When I’m not working on models or learning new frameworks, you’ll probably find me playing guitar — I enjoy the the energy of rock and metal.  
I believe in practical learning, building real projects, and constantly refining my understanding of how data can power decisions and creativity.
